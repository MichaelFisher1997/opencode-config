# SLOID Guidelines

Follow the **SLOID** (Standard Lightweight OpenCode Integration and Development) principles:

## The 5 Principles

1. **S - Simple**: Keep code and solutions simple, straightforward, and maintainable
2. **L - Lightweight**: Prefer minimal dependencies and overhead
3. **O - Open**: Use open-source solutions when possible, avoid proprietary lock-in
4. **I - Integrated**: Ensure tools and solutions integrate well with existing workflows
5. **D - Direct**: Be direct and concise in communication and code

## Decision Making

When making technical decisions:
- Choose simpler solutions over complex ones
- Prefer lightweight libraries over heavy frameworks
- Favor open-source alternatives
- Ensure compatibility with existing tools and workflows
- Keep code and explanations concise and to the point
